## heyjude

The `heyjude` repo contains basic codes to understand fundamnetals of coding. 

Most of the recent additions are in `python3`, but you may find some stuff written in `python2`. And I have try adding `bash` and `ansible` too.  More `ansible` codes coming soon... 

I try to organise these codes into different categories. but I'll have to organise my interview codes properly, that's on my TODO list.


A little `tree` to show how the current repo structure look like. 

```--- Ansible
--- Bash
   --- interview_questions
--- Python
   --- basics
      --- data_structures
