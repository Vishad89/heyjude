## heyjude

The `heyjude` repo contains basic codes to understand fundamnetals of coding. 

Most of the recent additions are in `python3`, but you may find some stuff written in `python2`. I have tried adding some `bash` and `ansible` codes too.  and planning to add more `ansible` codes soon... 

I try organizing these codes into different categories, so they can be easily found. 

A little `tree` to show how the current repo structure look like.
