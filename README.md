All the basic codes here are to clear up fundamentals for programming.

I keep adding stuff regularly here, but sometimes it's not organized. 

I am trying to organize it, but still you'll find some codes here and there under wrong name or dirs.

Most of the codes are eithere `scripting` or `algorithms` or `problem solving`. 

All the codes are either `ansible` (rarely), `python` (most of them) and `bash`.

Some `txt` or random files are requried for the codes. So you can igonore them and create them locally as required.
